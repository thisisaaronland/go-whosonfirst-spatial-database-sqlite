# go-whosonfirst-spatial-database-sqlite

## Important

This is work in progress and doesn't do anything yet.

The goal is to have a package that conforms to the [database.SpatialDatabase](https://github.com/whosonfirst/go-whosonfirst-spatial#spatialdatabase) interface using [mattn/go-sqlite3](https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3) and SQLite's [RTree](https://www.sqlite.org/rtree.html) extension.
